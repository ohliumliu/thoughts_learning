\section{Covariance matrix and inertia tensor}
Principal component analysis is used to transform the data so that unimportant dimensions can be revealed and later ignored. It helps to reduce the complexity of the model.

The idea is intuitive. Facing a distribution of data in the feature space, one would like to see if the data collapse along certain dimensions. This problem actually resembles the introduction of inertia tensor in mechanics.
